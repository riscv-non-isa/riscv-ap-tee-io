= RISC-V AP-TEE-IO TG Charter 

In order to achieve high performance Input/Output (I/O) operations, Trusted
Execution Environment Virtual Machines (TVM) must extend their trust boundary
to include a composition of directly assigned, TEE-I/O-capable
devices/functions. Without this ability, TVMs have to resort to using
para-virtualized I/O using non-confidential memory regions, which has
performance impacts due to memory copies and negates use of accelerators used
for dense compute. This TG will define CoVE-IO ABI extensions to provide
Confidential VM-assigned devices with secure direct access to confidential
memory as well as MMIO and Message Signal Interrupt (MSI), removing the
dependence on para-virtualized I/O.

The AP-TEE-IO TG will work on the following deliverables; where applicable, the
ABI extensions are expected to extend the AP-TEE TEE-Host/TEE-Guest ABIs:

* A normative non-ISA ABI specification between a non-TCB (host or guest)
  software and an AP-TEE compliant TEE Security Manager (TSM). This interface
  will cover:
** Enable an untrusted OS/VMM to assign/revoke TEE-I/O devices to/from TVMs.
** Enable TVMs to verify and attest to a device trustworthiness before accepting
   it into its TCB via the use of a Trusted Device Manager (TDM).
* Requirements for IOMMU extensions (non-ISA) to support performant TEE-I/O
  devices DMA to confidential memory, secure MMIO and trusted MSI.
* Non-normative extensions to the AP-TEE security recommendations to describe
  the software flows and protocols that may be used for device attestation and
  updates.

The TG will work on extending the AP-TEE PoC for an open source implementation
for TEE-IO. The development of the deliverables will happen in collaboration
with other SIGs/TGs that the TEE-I/O framework depends on, e.g. the AP-TEE,
Hypervisor and IOMMU TGs.

Device-specific and interconnect security mechanisms required to establish and
maintain trust between the TVM and its assigned devices is out-of-scope for this
TG. The recommendations will refer to industry-defined frameworks to address
these aspects that are being developed in DMTF (CMA/SPDM), PCI-SIG (TDISP and
IDE) and CXL proposed standards.
