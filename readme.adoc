= Dependencies

This project is built using AsciiDoctor (Ruby). The repository has been setup to build the PDF on
checkin using GitHub actions.  Workflow dependencies are located in the `dependencies` directory.

https://github.com/riscv/docs-dev-guide[RISC-V Documentation Developer Guide].

= Cloning the project

This project uses https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[GitHub Submodules]
to include the https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources[RISC-V docs-resources project]
to achieve a common look and feel.

When cloning this repository for the first time, you must either use
`git clone --recurse-submodules` or execute `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` after the clone to populate the docs-resources directory.  Failure to clone the submodule, will result
in the PDF build fail with an error message like the following:

    $ make
    asciidoctor-pdf \
    -a toc \
    -a compress \
    -a pdf-style=docs-resources/themes/riscv-pdf.yml \
    -a pdf-fontsdir=docs-resources/fonts \
    --failure-level=ERROR \
    -o profiles.pdf profiles.adoc
    asciidoctor: ERROR: could not locate or load the built-in pdf theme `docs-resources/themes/riscv-pdf.yml'; reverting to default theme
    No such file or directory - notoserif-regular-subset.ttf not found in docs-resources/fonts
      Use --trace for backtrace
    make: *** [Makefile:7: profiles.pdf] Error 1

= Building the document

The final specification form of PDF can be generated using the `make` command.
