== Confidential VM Extension (CoVE) IO ABI

=== CoVE IO Function IDs Namespace

As a <<CoVE>> SBI extension, CoVE-IO has a reserved CoVE Function ID (FID)
namespace. For all three CoVE EID (`COVH`, `COVI` and `COVG`), the CoVE-IO FIDs
must be in the `[1024:1087]` range.

                                      unsigned long msi_cfg[3]);
-----

Registers an IOMMU (`iommu_id`) with a TSM. The `msi_cfg` MSI vectors are
allocated by the host security domain manager (e.g. the host VMM).

The TSM configures the IOMMU TSM security domain programming interface
`s_msi_cfg_table` with the provided MSI vectors.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

===== Function: CoVE Host Notify IOMMU MSI (FID #1025)
[source, C]
-----
struct sbiret sbi_covh_notify_iommu_msi(unsigned long iommu_id);
-----

Notifies the TSM about a pending MSI for the TSM security domain.

When servicing this request, the TSM must first verify that there are pending
MSIs, by reading the IOMMU `s_ipsr` register from the IOMMU TSM security
domain programming interface. If there are some, it handles the interrupts as
needed.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

-----

Registers a PCIe Root Port (RP) for TEE I/O and IDE ownership with the TSM.

This function associates a RP id to its MMIO space (for configuring the RP IDE
capability) and all the MMIO ranges that are routed through it.

The TSM must compare these 2 arguments with the information it received from
the platform ROT through the TEE I/O manifest. If both match, it can proceed
into establishing an SPDM session with the RP.

                                        unsigned long stream_id);
-----

Establishes a secure SPDM session between the TSM and a device identified by
`device_id`, and configure the PCIe IDE link between that device and its
upstream Root Port. The configured IDE link must use the selective IDE stream
identified by `stream_id`.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

[source, C]
-----
struct sbiret sbi_covh_disconnect_device()(unsigned long device_id);
-----

Disconnects the TSM from the device identified by `device_id`.

The TSM must first stop all TVM-bound interfaces belonging to `device_id`, clear
the IDE link and keys for `device_id` and then terminate the secure SPDM session
established with `device_id`.

                                                unsigned long region_len);
-----

Adds a device interface MMIO region into a TVM address space.

The host supervisor domain manager must call this function for all
`device_if_id` MMIO regions before binding it to `tvm_id`. This function returns
an error if `device_if_id` is already bound to `tvm_id`.

The TSM creates uncacheable G-stage mappings for the added region, so that the
TVM outbound transaction will not trigger MMIO page faults. The TSM must not
enable the created mappings until the TVM accepts the TDI in its TCB.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

`base_addr` value must be 4KB-aligned.

`region_len` value must be 4KB-aligned.

-----

Reclaims a device interface MMIO region previously added to a TVM address space.

The host supervisor domain manager may call this function when the `tvm_id` TVM
stops the `device_if_id` device interface, in order for the TSM to unmap the
device interface MMIO ranges from the TVM address space.

If `device_if_id` is still bound to `tvm_id` when this call is made, the TSM
unbinds the device interface from the TVM first.

The possible error codes returned in `sbiret.error` are shown below.

`base_addr` value must be 4KB-aligned.

-----

Binds a TVM and a device interface together.

The TSM returns an error if a secured SPDM session is not established with the
DSM or if a stream IDE link is not set up.

measurement transcript, including `VCA` and all `{GET_MEASUREMENTS, MEASUREMENTS}`
pairs that are exchanged between the SPDM measurement requester and the
responder. Only the last `MEASUREMENTS` shall include the digital signature of
the measurement transcript.

The `nonce_addr` parameter points at an optional 32 bytes long buffer holding a
cryptographic nonce.

For any non zero value, the nonce is used as the SPDM `GET_MEASUREMENTS` request
`Nonce` field. When set to `0x0`, the TSM ignores this argument and generates a
nonce on behalf of the TVM.

`msmt_req_attr` is used as the measurement request attributes in SPDM
`GET_MEASUREMENT` request `param1` field. Only `RawBitStreamRequested` bit is
valid and the rest bits are igored. The last `GET_MEASUREMENT` request must
set `SignatureRequested` bit to request the digital signaure of the measurement
transcript.

Both `msmt_addr_out` and `nonce_addr` must be 4KB-aligned.
