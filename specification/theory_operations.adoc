== Theory of Operations

The CoVE-IO specification extends the CoVE host and guest SBI extensions to
allow TVMs to establish trust with TEE-IO devices, and then use and interact
with those devices. Untrusted supervisor domain components are responsible for
assigning TEE-IO devices to TVMs, and also for supporting the TVM acceptance or
rejection of the assigned devices. The TSM, on the other hand, establishes and
maintains the secure physical and logical links between TVMs and their assigned
devices.

The following sections describe the functionality of the TSM-provided CoVE-IO
extensions to support trusted I/O on CoVE-enabled platforms.

=== Platform Initialization

==== IOMMU Registration and Setup

The TSM relies on the availability of at least one IOMMU instance exclusvely
associated with the TSM supervisor domain. Those IOMMUs allow the TSM to enforce
the integrity of address translations and protection from DMA into confidential
memory, as well as  interrupts originating from assigned TDIs. The host
supervisor domain may assign one or more IOMMU instances to the TSM supervisor
domain, after which, only the TSM can access and program the assigned IOMMU
instances.

IOMMUs assigned to the TSM security domain may generate MSIs in order to signal
the TSM about command completions, transaction faults or device page requests.
Those MSIs target system physical memory, which is owned by the host security
domain manager, e.g. the host VMM. As a consequence, it is the host security
domain's responsibility to reserve the MSI addresses and then rely on the TSM to
program the IOMMUs with those reserved addresses. This IOMMU registration
process is driven by the untrusted domain manager for all IOMMUs that
participate in TEE-IO and operates as described in the following steps:

1. The TSM is loaded into a supervisor domain and provisioned with a CoVE-IO
   manifest. It is recommended that the TSM is measured by the platform
   root-of-trust for subsequent attestation.
2. The host supervisor domain manager (e.g. the host VMM) enumerates all
   platform IOMMUs as PCIe devices.
3. The host IOMMU driver is loaded and probed.
4. The host IOMMU driver allocates MSI vectors for the trusted domain
   IOMMUs. Those vectors must point to the untrusted IOMMU driver as the TSM can
   not handle external interrupts.
5. The host supervisor domain manager registers the IOMMUs with the TSM by
   calling the `sbi_covh_register_iommu()` COVH function. The TSM gets the
   allocated MSI vectors and configures the trusted IOMMU `s_msi_cfg_table`
   register accordingly.
6. When a trusted IOMMU sends an MSI, the untrusted IOMMU driver handles it and
   notifies the TSM about a pending trusted IOMMU MSI by calling the
   `sbi_covh_notify_iommu_msi()` COVH function.
7. The TSM verifies that there is a pending MSI by reading the IOMMU `s_ipsr`
   register, and handles the interrupts as needed.

The host IOMMU driver may be malicious and attempt to trick the TSM by either
invoking the `sbi_covh_notify_iommu_msi()` COVH function while there are no
pending MSI from the trusted IOMMU or not invoking it when there actually is one
such pending interrupt. In the former case, the TSM can verify that there really
is a pending MSI by checking the trusted IOMMU status registers. The latter case
could cause a denial of service, which is not in scope of the confidential
computing threat model. If the TSM must ensure that a given command is completed
without having to rely on untrusted IOMMU driver MSI notifications, it can queue
an `IOFENCE.C` command after the desired command and check for the `cqh`
advancing past the `IOFENCE.C` command index.

==== PCIe Root Port Registration

When the data link between the TDI and the TVM must be secured, trusted I/O
relies on the PCIe IDE protocol. IDE provides confidentiality and integrity
protection for TLPs received and transmitted between the physical device the TDI
belongs to and its assigned PCIe root port (RP). Both endpoints (The RP and the
physical device) must be configured with the same encryption keys through the
IDE key management protocols and have their IDE PCIe extended capability
configured as well.

As described in the threat model and requirement sections, the following trusted
I/O rules apply:

* As PCIe switches are outside of the TVM TCB, only selective IDE streams are
  used to protect the PCIe link between the TVM and the TDI.
* A single selective IDE stream is established between the physical device and
  its Root Port. All TDIs from the physical device share this single IDE stream.
* For each physical device from which a TDI is attached to a TVM, the TSM
  generates, owns and distributes the IDE stream keys to both the physical
  device and the RP.
* The TSM configures the RP PCIe IDE extended capability.

As the TSM is responsible for setting both the RP IDE keys and PCI IDE
capabilities, it must be the IDE operations owner for any downstream device for
a given RP. As the overall platform resources owner, the host supervisor domain
software stack must register a RP for TEE I/O and IDE ownership with the TSM, by
calling the `sbi_covh_register_rp()` COVH function. This function associates a
RP id to its MMIO space (for the IDE capability configurations) and all the MMIO
ranges that are routed through it. The TSM must compare these 2 arguments with
the information it received from the platform ROT through the TEE I/O manifest.
If both match, it can proceed into establishing an SPDM session with the RP.

===== Root-of-Trust SPDM Session

For each TDI that gets attached to a TVM, its corresponding PCIe root port must
be configured with per-device IDE keys. This configuration is done through the
PCIe IDE key management protocol (IDE_KM) that runs on top of an SPDM session.
It is thus necessary to establish an SPDM session with all trusted I/O
registered root ports. This is akin to considering the RP as just another
trusted device for which the DSM is the platform ROT. The SPDM establishment
thus happens between the TSM and the platform ROT. By having the ROT playing the
RP DSM role, the RP vendor-specific IDE key management interface is abstracted
by the ROT.

.PCIe Root Port IDE Key Management through Hardware Root-of-Trust
image::images/rp_rot_idekm.svg[align="center"]

// After the host supervisor domain manager successfully registers a root port with
// the TSM, it requests the TSM to establish a secured SPDM session (together with
// the IDE stream setup) with it by calling the COVH `sbi_covh_connect_device()`
// function. The same function is used for establishing SPDM sessions with PCIe
// root ports and physical devices acting as SPDM responders. The Secured SPDM
// Session section describes the protocol followed by the TSM and the SPDM
// responder to establish this secured session.

=== SPDM Transport

SPDM is the main transport protocol for securely setting both the RP and the
physical device IDE keys and also for driving the TDI through the TDISP state
machine.

Whether the SPDM session is established with the ROT or the physical device, the
TSM is the requester and it must reach and communicate with DOE mailboxes that
are owned by the host supervisor domain manager. As a consequence, after
requesting the TSM to establish an SPDM session with a device (through the
`sbi_covh_connect_device()` COVH call), it acts as an untrusted SPDM messages
proxy between the TSM and the device DSM.

After a successful call to `sbi_covh_connect_device()`, host supervisor domain
initiated CoVE-IO COVH calls that require SPDM requests to be sent to the device
DOE mailbox follows the flow described below:

....

The TSM generates the SPDM request to support the initial CoVE-IO COVH call and
copies the request into the per-vcpu shared, non-confidential memory region that
the host supervisor domain and the TSM share as per the CoVE specification. The
TSM replies to the host supervisor domain manager request with the `SBI_SUCCESS`
error code and the `SPDM_PENDING_REQUEST (0x1)` value through the `sbiret`
structure. The host supervisor domain manager then sends the pending SPDM
request to the device DOE mailbox. It forwards the device SPDM response to the
TSM, by copying it to the same SPDM buffer it fetches the SPDM request from and
by calling again the same CoVE-IO COVH call.
This process continues until the initial CoVE-IO call is completed. The TSM then
replies to the last COVH call with the appropriate error code and the
`SPDM_REQUEST_COMPLETED (0x0)` value through the `sbiret` structure.

The TSM only supports one pending SPDM transaction per device, and the CoVE NACL
shared memory holds one pending SPDM action buffer per device the TSM is
connected to. Each pending SPDM action buffer is structured as described in the
following layout:

In this document, for readability reasons, flow definitions that involve SPDM
based exchanges are simplified and do not include the above described flow
between the TSM, the host supervisor domain manager and the SPDM responder. In
particular, the steps that cover the SPDM request generation from the TSM, the
transmission to the host VMM, the transmission to the SPDM responder and finally
the path back to the TSM are reduced into 2 steps:

1. TSM sends SPDM request #1
2. TSM receives SPDM response #1

For example the above example would be described through those simplified steps:

1. VMM calls `sbi_covh_tee_io_action()`
2. TSM sends SPDM request #1
3. TSM receives SPDM response #1
4. TSM sends SPDM request #2
5. TSM receives SPDM response #2
6. TSM returns `sbi_covh_tee_io_action()`

==== Secure SPDM Session

With trusted I/O, the TSM establishes SPDM sessions with both the ROT and the
physical devices DSMs. As those sessions are used to exchange IDE keys through
the `IDE_KM` protocol while going through the host supervisor domain manager,
they need to be confidentiality and integrity protected. Establishing a secured
SPDM session for IDE key management or TDISP operations between the TSM and
either PCIe root ports or devices is a mandatory requirement for TVMs to accept
TDIs into their TCB.

Any trusted I/O SPDM session is established through the SPDM responder DOE
mailbox, which could be either the ROT acting as a DSM for the PCIe root ports,
or the physical device DSM. In either case the mailboxes are resources owned by
the host security domain manager which thus initiates the SPDM session
establishment. It acts as an untrusted proxy between the TSM and the DSM by
requesting the TSM to generate SPDM requests through the CoVIO COVHTH ABI,
sending those requests to the DOE mailbox and forwarding the SPDM responses back
to the TSM, as described in the SPDM flow section.

=== Device Initialization

After the IOMMU is registered with the TSM, the host supervisor domain manager
must cooperate with the TSM to properly initialize any device from which a TDI
could be assigned to a TVM.

The device initialization process aims at establishing secured,
integrity-protected control and data planes between the TSM and the
DSM running in either the platform ROT or a physical PCIe device.
The secured control plane is based on the SPDM protocol and is an encrypted,
integrity-protected software session that is used for passing TDISP and IDE_KM
messages between the TSM and the DSM.
The data place is a hardware session based on the PCIe Integrity and Data
Encryption (IDE) specification and is used to secure the PCIe TLPs.

When the host supervisor domain detects a new TEE-IO capable device, it must go
through two device initialization steps:

1. Establish a secured SPDM session between the TSM (The SPDM Requester) and the
   device DSM (The SPDM responder).
2. Set the PCIe IDE stream up for encrypting the PCIe link.

The CoVE-IO COVH extension supports those two initialization steps through one
single function: `sbi_covh_connect_device()`.

When the host supervisor domain manager calls `sbi_covh_connect_device()`, it
requests the TSM to establish an SPDM session with a device, and to set an PCIe
IDE link between the device and the TSM.

==== SPDM Session

The first step for initializing a TEE-IO capable device is to establish a
secured SPDM session between the TSM an the device. The secured SPDM sessions
will then be used to carry `TDISP` and `IDE_KM` messages, in order to
respectively secure the physical link between the device and its PCIe root port,
and for assigning or unassigning TDIs from a TVM.

The host supervisor domain manager requires the TSM to establish a secured SPDM
session with the physical device by calling the `sbi_covh_connect_device()`
COVH function. Before proceeding into actually establishing the session, the TSM
must check that:

1. The physical device is a downstream endpoint of a root port that
   the host supervisor domain manager has previously registered with the TSM.
2. A secured SPDM session between the TSM and the upstream root port is
   established.

The TSM establishes a secured SPDM session with the physical device DSM by going
through the steps described in the Secured SPDM Session section.

==== IDE Link

The SPDM session is a software link between the TSM and the DSM, secured after
both entities go through a DHE key exchange over the untrusted host supervisor
domain manager proxy. SPDM is used as a control link for configuring the rest of
the device and then running the TDI assignment flows.

The last part of the device initialization is about securing the data link
between the TSM and the device, and that must be done through the IDE Key
Management protocol.
Here again, the host supervisor domain manager initiates the PCI IDE link setup
by calling the `sbi_covh_connect_device` COVH function, and relies on the TSM to
generate and send IDE KM messages over SPDM.

The TSM is responsible for:
1. Configuring the PCIe root port IDE Extended Capability.
2. Generating the IDE keys for all sub-streams for a given stream ID.
3. Setting the PCIe root port IDE keys for a given stream ID, through IDE KM
   requests.
4. Refreshing the PCIe root port IDE keys for a given stream ID.
5. Generating all IDE KM requests and encapsulating them into SPDM messages.
6. Setting the PCIe device IDE keys through IDE KM requests.

The host VMM is responsible for:
1. Generating and managing system wide PCIe stream IDs.
2. Setting the device PCIe device IDE PCI Extended Capability.
4. Initiating the IDE link setup.

The IDE link initial setup must go through the following steps:

1. The host supervisor domain manager finds an available stream ID and
   configures the device IDE Extended Capability accordingly.
2. The host supervisor domain manager programs the device IDE extended
   capability: All RIDs and all memory is allowed, IDE is enabled.
3. The host supervisor domain manager initiates the IDE link setup by calling
   the `sbi_covh_connect_device` COVH function.
4. The TSM programs the Root Port IDE Extended Capability with the proper RID
   range and the stream ID selected by the host supervisor domain manager in
   step 1. The capability is only accessible to the TSM, i.e. any writes to it
   with the C-bit set to 0 are dropped and reads return all 1s.
5. The TSM generates an IDE key for each sub-stream for the stream ID.
6. The TSM, for each Rx and Tx sub-stream (6 of them), programs the generated
   keys into the physical device:
   a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM KEY_PROG` message to the DSM. The message
      is encapsulated in a vendor-defined SPDM request.
   b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY KP_ACK` from the DSM.
7. The TSM, for each Rx and Tx sub-stream (6 of them), programs the generated
   keys into the physical device’s PCIe root port:
   a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM KEY_PROG` message to the ROT. The message
      is encapsulated into a vendor-defined SPDM request.
   b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY KP_ACK` from the ROT.
8. The TSM, for each Rx sub-stream (3 of them), triggers IDE in the physical
   device:
   a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM SET_GO(Rx)` message to the DSM. The message
      is encapsulated into a vendor-defined SPDM request.
   b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY K_GOSTOP_ACK` from the DSM.
9. The TSM, for each Rx sub-stream (3 of them), triggers IDE in the physical
   device’s PCIe root port:
   a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM SET_GO(Rx)` message to the ROT. The message
      is encapsulated into a vendor-defined SPDM request.
   b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY K_GOSTOP_ACK` from the ROT.
10. The TSM, for each Tx sub-stream (3 of them), triggers IDE in the physical
    device:
   a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM SET_GO(Tx)` message to the DSM. The message
      is encapsulated into a vendor-defined SPDM request.
   b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY K_GOSTOP_ACK` from the DSM.
11. The TSM, for each Tx sub-stream (3 of them), triggers IDE in the physical
    device’s PCIe root port:
    a. Generates and sends an `IDE_KM SET_GO(Tx)` message to the ROT. The
        message is encapsulated into a vendor-defined SPDM request.
    b. Receives an `IDE_KM_KEY K_GOSTOP_ACK` from the DSM.
