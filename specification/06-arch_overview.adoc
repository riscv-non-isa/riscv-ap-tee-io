== Architectural Overview

CoVE-IO is made of multiple hardware and software components.

Figure 1 below illustrates the overall CoVE-IO architectural components and how
they interact together:

The TEE Security Manager (TSM) orchestrates and manages TEE Virtual Machines
(TVM), as defined by the <<CoVE>> specification. The TSM operates in HS-Mode
and is the confidential supervisor domain manager. It uses the <<Smmtt>>
specified Memory Tracking Table (MTT) to enforce TVM memory isolation from
the host supervisor domain.

As the confidential security domain manager, the TSM provides the `COVH` ABI
for the host OS/VMM to create and destroy TVMs, and donate or reclaim
confidential memory from them. TVMs can interact with the TSM through the
`COVG` ABI.

CoVE-IO extends both the `COVH` and `COVG` ABIs for bringing TEE-IO capable
devices into the trust boundary of TVMs. These extensions allow for configuring
and registering IOMMUs and PCIe root ports, and then binding physical devices
interfaces (TDI) and TVMs together.

With the CoVE-IO ABIs and flows, TDIs can access TVM confidential memory
directly. Based on the TVM configuration, the confidential DMA memory
could be all TVM memory or a subset of the TVM memory.
CoVE-IO uses the Smmtt I/O MTT extension and the platform IOMMUs
security domain specific Register Programming Interfaces (RPI) to grant TDIs
with direct access to their bound TVM confidential memory and isolate it from
DMA originating from any unbound TDI.

With the CoVE-IO model, the TVM ultimately holds the decision to accept or
reject a bound TDI into or from its TCB. Access to a TVM confidential memory
from a TDI is disabled until a TVM notifies the TSM that it trusts the TDI and
its configuration. The TVM communicates this decision after verifying the TDI,
which generally includes attesting to the physical device the TDI belongs to.
The device attestation process is specific to each TVM workload configuration,
but it may be handled by the Trusted Device Manager (TDM).

In order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of TVM data between the
PCIe root port and a bound TDI, CoVE-IO relies on the TSM to configure both the
PCIe physical device and the root port it's attached to in order to establish
IDE streams between the two. The PCIe root port IDE configuration from the TSM
is abstracted through the platform Root-of-Trust (RoT).
