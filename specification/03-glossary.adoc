| Term            ^| Acronym | Definition

| Application Processor | AP | APs can support commodity operating systems,
hypervisors/VMMs and applications software workloads. The AP subsystem may
contain several processing units, on-chip caches, and other controllers
for interfacing with memory, accelerators, and other fixed-function logic.
Multiple APs may be used within a logical system.

| Application Processor- Trusted Execution Environment | AP-TEE |  An execution
mode that provides HW-isolation for workload assets when in use (user/supervisor
code/ data) and provides HW-attestable confidentiality and integrity protection
against specific attack vectors per a specified adversary and threat model. The
term CoVE, TEE and hardware-based TEE are also used as synonyms of AP-TEE in
this document.

| Attestation | N/A | The process by which a relying party can assess the
security posture of the confidential workload based on verifying a set of
HW-rooted cryptographically-protected evidence.

| Confidential Computing | N/A | The protection of data in use by performing
computation in a Hardware-based TEE.

| Confidential VM Extension | CoVE | A set of non-ISA RISC-V extensions that
enables confidential computing on RISC-V platforms.

| CoVE Guest SBI Extension | COVG | CoVE SBI extensions serviced by the TSM
and called by TVMs.

| CoVE Host SBI Extension | COVH | CoVE SBI extensions serviced by the TSM
and called by host software components.

| Device Interface | DI | TDISP term, Device Interface. Same as a TDI. A DI can
be a Virtual Function (VF) or a Physical Function (PF).

| Device Security Manager | DSM | A DSM is a logical entity on a TEE-IO device
that enforces the TDISP security policies, attributes and states.

| Direct Memory Access | DMA | The ability for a device to directly read and
write into the host physical memory.

| Host platform | N/A | The combination of the host software stack and the host
hardware components. The host hardware components include all SoC components
(CPU, memory controller, power management IP blocks, etc) and all discrete ones
(Root of Trust, IOMMU, physical memory, etc).

| Host software | N/A | All software elements including type-1 or type-2 HS-mode
VMM and OS; U mode user-space VMM tools; ordinary VMs hosted by the VMM that
emulate devices. The hosting platform is typically a multi-tenant platform that
hosts multiple mutually distrusting Tenants.

| Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor | VMM | HS mode software
that manages Virtual Machines by virtualizing hart, guest physical memory and IO
resources. This document uses the term VMM and hypervisor interchangeably for
this software entity.

| Input/Output Memory Management Unit | IOMMU | A system agent that translates
device virtual addresses to physical addresses.

| Integrity and Data Encryption | IDE | Extended PCIe capability for integrity,
confidentiality and replay protection of PCIe Transport Layer Packets (TLP).

| I/O Translation Agent | N/A | Same as an IOMMU.

| Platform TCB | TCB | Platform Trusted Computing Base, same as TCB.

| Physical Device | N/A | The physical device to which DIs belong to. This is the
actual physical PCIe device.

| Root of Trust | ROT | Isolated HW/SW subsystem with an immutable ROM firmware
and  isolated compute and memory elements that form the Trusted Compute Base
of a TEE system. The RoT manages cryptographic keys and other security
critical functions such as system lifecycle and debug authorization.
The RoT provides trusted services to other software on the platform such
as verified boot, key provisioning, and management, security lifecycle
management, sealed storage, device management, crypto services,
attestation etc. The RoT may be an integrated or discrete element, and may take
on the role of a Device Identification Composition Engine (DICE).

| Secure Protocol and Data Model | SPDM | A DMTF defined specification for
exchanging messages between devices over a variety of transports and physical
media. In the CoVE-IO context, SPDM is used to exchange TDISP and IDE
Key Management messages over PCIe DOE mailboxes.

| System TCB | TCB | System Trusted Computing Base, same as TCB.

| TEE Device Interface Security Protocol | TDISP | An architecture for trusted
I/O virtualization.

| TEE I/O Device Interface | TDI | The unit of assignment for a trusted I/O
capable device. For example, a TDI can be a Virtual Function (VF) or a Physical
Function (PF).

| TEE Security Manager | TSM | HS-mode software module that acts as the trusted
(in TCB) intermediary between the VMM and the TVM. This module extends the TCB
chain on the CoVE platform.

| Transaction Layer Packet | TLP |

| Trusted Computing Base | TCB | The hardware, software and firmware elements
that are trusted by a relying party to protect the confidentiality and integrity
of the relying parties' workload data and execution against a defined adversary
model. In a system with separate processing elements within a package on a
socket, the TCB boundary is the package. In a multi-socket system the TCB
extends across the socket-to-socket interface, and is managed as one system TCB.

| Trusted Device Manager | TDM | A CoVE-IO device manager, responsible for
verifying, attesting and accepting CoVE-IO devices into a TVM TCB. This is a TVM
guest software stack component.

| Trusted Memory Mapped Input Output | Trusted MMIO | A TDI memory mapped I/O
region that can only be accessed by a TVM that accepted the TDI in its TCB. TDIs
describe their trusted MMIO regions through TDISP. The TVM, with the TSM
support, is responsible for verifying that trusted MMIO ranges are correctly
mapped into its address space.

| TEE VM | TVM | A VM instantiation of an confidential workload.

| Virtual Machine | VM | Virtual Machines hosted by a VMM
